# python-challenge

In this Challenge, I was  tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
